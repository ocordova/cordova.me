[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) is a cloud scripting service based in JavaScript and makes it easy to do cool things with most of Google's products. Lately, I've been a big fan of its flexibility and versatility, for example with just a few lines of code you can interact with the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) to control your bot, you won't have to worry about having a server, SSL certificates or configure ports üòè.

## ü§î What We Are Going to Do

Our goal is to create a simple Telegram bot that replies to a command with a random quote from [Quotes on Design](https://quotesondesign.com/).

You can test it just by starting a conversation with [DesignQuotesBot](https://telegram.me/DesignQuotesBot) and sending the command `/quote`.

Now let's get started with the step by step instructions üòä

## ü§ñ Meet BotFather

The first step is to talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) to create and setup our bot, he will also give us our authorization token.

Sign in to Telegram from your favorite device and search for the account **BotFather** and start a conversation.

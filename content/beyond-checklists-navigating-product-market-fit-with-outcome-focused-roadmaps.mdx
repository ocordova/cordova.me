  description: Discover how an outcomes-driven roadmap can help achieve product-market fit and drive long-term success.

As product developers, we're constantly reminded of the vital role of achieving product-market fit. It's a journey filled with iterations, adaptations, and the perpetual quest for alignment within our teams.

Traditionally, roadmaps have been our go-to tool for steering through these challenges. However, I've noticed that traditional roadmaps often lead us down the wrong path. We get caught up in checking off features instead of focusing on whether those features actually move us closer to our goal of achieving product-market fit.

That's where outcomes-driven roadmaps come in. Unlike traditional roadmaps that focus on tasks, these roadmaps are all about reaching specific business goals and meeting customer needs. They shift our focus from completing tasks to delivering measurable results and real value.

Imagine this: Instead of a task like "Develop Notification System," we set a clear goal like "Increase user engagement by 25% by the end of Q4." or instead of "Send a promotional email campaign," it would say, "Increase sales by 8%". This not only gives us direction but also sparks creativity within our team as we brainstorm ways to achieve these outcomes.

Choosing the right metrics is crucial. For us, the [HEART framework](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/heart-framework/) has been incredibly helpful. It provides a comprehensive approach—Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success—for evaluating and improving our product's performance.

So, as we continue our journey toward product-market fit, I'm reminded of the importance of embracing methodologies that keep us focused on our goals. Outcomes-driven roadmaps aren't just tools; they're guiding lights that show us the way to meeting our users' needs and achieving success.

In summary, it's not just about following a roadmap; it's about navigating toward meaningful outcomes that matter to both our team and our users.

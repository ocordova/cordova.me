I went through period of boredom at work, no new challenges or something new to learn, so to get rid of that boredom I decided to answer some questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3075569/ocordova) (mainly in the `google-apps-script` and other Google Apps related tags where you actually answer ðŸ˜‚). I got really hooked up, but after hitting 1k rep and earning a gold badge an idea occurred to me, write blog posts about web development, design and things I found interesting. I didnâ€™t have a blog, so after considering Wordpress, Tumblr and other platforms, I decided to learn and use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), because I heard that's what the cool kids use nowadays.

Iâ€™ve noticed that writing helps me put my thoughts together and allows me to express myself better [AFK](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=afk) situations. The funny thing is Iâ€™m terrible at writing (as you may have noticed), surely writing the first posts is going to take me some time, but if that were not enough challenge I decided to translate all my post to Spanish. So, letâ€™s all hope I can craft some posts that are understandable and interesting to others ðŸ¤ž.

Thatâ€™s all for today! Thanks for stopping by and see you soon ðŸ˜Š.
